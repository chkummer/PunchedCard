# Card Code
A very good information source about how the different codings is the [Punched Card Codes](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/codes.html) Page which is Part of [ Douglas W. Jones Punched Card Collection](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/index.html).
Other good resources are:
* [The Punched Card](http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/cardint.htm)
* [Collected Information on Punched Card Codes](http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/literature/chapman/p013.htm)
* [100+ Codes](https://ub.fnwi.uva.nl/computermuseum/DWcodes.html) Compiled by the late Dik Winter (CWI, Amsterdam).

## IBM026
The [IBM 026](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/026.html) is a [Key Punching Machine](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/keypunch.html) to create punched cards. The Machine was introduced in July 1949. It is the first Key Punching Machine where the Operator had Keyboard like a Typewriter before there was one key per hole (the coding was done manually by the Operator).

### Code Plates
Code Plates where used to 'store' the 5 × 7 dot matrix character glyphs. The code plate is a tiny, roughly stamp-sized piece of metal containing a grid of tiny projections. The purpose of this code plate is to encode and generate character glyphs in a flexible manner: Where there are projections, a printing dot is encoded, where the projections are milled off, the respective dot will remain blank. On the IBM026 the Code Plate had a 7 x 8 Code Grid which had 47 valid characters for printing. This Code Grid was enlarged for the later Models IBM029 and IBM129. See the [Punched Card Typography — IBM 026, 029, 129](https://www.masswerk.at/misc/card-punch-typography/) for more information.

For the IBM026 the following Code Plates existed (This Information was taken from  [24 Card Punch 26 Printing Card Punch Parts Catalog](http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/ibm/punchedCard/Keypunch/024-026/123-7091-3_24_25_Parts_Catalog_Apr1963.pdf) on Page 21 Print Unit Asm Code Plate). Option A and H where the most common one.
