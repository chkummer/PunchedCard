# PunchedCard
Creating [Punched Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) using Laser Printer and [Laser Cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting).

The idea came when somebody at the 'Vintage Computer Festival Zurich' showed me the [Virtual Keypunch](https://www.masswerk.at/keypunch/) (by [mass:werk](https://www.masswerk.at/)) to visualize young Java-Programmers how much data for a SOAP-Request/-Response is sent.
